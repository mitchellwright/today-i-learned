# Edit videos in the browser

VEED.io is an in-browser video editor. It has a lot of really nice capabilities such as transitions, voice-overs, graphic overlays, etc.

I first heard about it from a [tweet by swyx](https://twitter.com/swyxio/status/1562456976759463936). He also shared a follow-up talk from the founders about [how they bootstrapped the product to $5M ARR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYS3QKJHUDM).

[Sabba Keynejad](https://twitter.com/sab8a) is one of their co-founders.
